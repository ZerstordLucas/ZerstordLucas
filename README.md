   Hello! 
My Name is Lucas Rodrigues, i´m 18 years old and live in Brazil. I´m at first semester in Computer Science by UFC (Federal Universty of Ceará). 
I´m beginner at this area, have so much things to chose, learn and improve, but, the first step has been taken!

I hope that we can learn and produce a lot of cool stuff and learn!

If you have something you'd like to share, like tips or anything about, just send me a message!
